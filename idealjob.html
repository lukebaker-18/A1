<!-- Start Content -->
<div id="About Me" class="w3-content">


<h2>IT Manager</h2>
<p style ="text-align:middle">My ideal job will allow me to have the flexibility to work both in an office 
environment with coworkers where I can share ideas and discuss projects, and equally
 the flexibility to work from home on my own.</p>
 

 <p style ="text-align:middle">Ideally, I would like a work-life balance
 which means that my working hours will not be excessive, will give me my nights and weekends
 free for socializing and sports. </p>
 
 <p style ="text-align:middle">I would like my job to give me a sense of pride and accomplishment,
 not be too stressful, and be well paid.</p>
 
 <p style ="text-align:middle">The prospect for travel is a positive as I think this will expand
 my knowledge and broaden my horizons, and the opportunity to see the world is attractive.</p>
 
 <p style ="text-align:middle">Working in IT
 provides flexibility because with technology advancing rapidly, it allows you to work remotely from anywhere,
 so the opportunities are endless.</p>
