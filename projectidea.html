<h2> Overview </h2>
<p> For this assignments project idea I have chosen to design and hopefully create an app
called “Find a Footy mate.” The idea behind why it is called this is due to the main part
of the app being a way to find and communicate with supporters of the same club and meet up
with these people to go and watch the footy. It provides a great way to make new friends meet 
new people who share the same interests as you and to watch something you both love. </p>


<h2> Motivation </h2>
<p> I believe that this project will be interesting as thousands of people each 
game go to the footy which means there are plenty of people to meet and share 
opinions on about the game you love with the people who support the same team as you.
Some people don’t go to the footy as their friends can’t go but with this new app the opportunities
are endless with many people to contact and message and meet up with to have a great time not alone.</p>


<h2> Description </h2>
<p>There would be many different features of the app, one being that the main purpose of the app 
is finding different people. This feature would work by using navigation tools to be able to show 
you the people who live closest to you, or people who live in the same state or region. Once the app
 has figured out the region and state you are in, different threads and requests will pop up of people
 who have listed themselves on the app and are actively looking for people to meet and interact with. 
 The user will have their own option to list themselves to allow other users to contact them and allow 
 communication both ways. Another feature will be the messaging section where only people that have seen
 your list or peoples list you have seen can contact each other, this will be useful to minimise spam messages
 from random users. To message a user there will be an added function on the user’s profile and if they accept
 your friend request you will be allowed to message each other. The messages between users will be kept private
 to ensure the privacy of the user’s and there will be a report function if a user is feeling threatened or uncomfortable 
 and it will let the devs know.  This reporting system will allow the users to feel safe and comfortable in using the app
 and will show users that ill appropriate messaging and bullying will not be allowed. Another feature of the app will be
 similar to the likes of a twitter feed but all related to the AFL and the team you support. This feature of the app will
 allow the user to post a topic of discussion and allow others to comment on it.  These comments can be made in real time
 at a  live AFL game,  allowing for in-game commentary ,  polling and voting system on best players, best goal, and best
 mark.  Users can be watching the game in the comforts of their own homes or present at the venue as long as they have 
 their phone and the app installed. </p>
<p>The software and hardware needed would be a mobile phone with storage capabilities to be able to run the application
 and have enough space and memory to have it  installed  and keep up with all future updates.</p>
<p> By using the web application flutter.dev, the overall design of the application can be made and further established.
 The features of the web app enables the developer to thoroughly plan and create the idea into a functioning and usable
 application. The developer can make mock ups and brainstorm ideas until they find the one that’s best for the application
 ensuring it is user friendly.</p> 


<h2> Skills Required </h2>
<p>The software needed to produce my project would be an app development website where I can sort and design what all
 stages of the app will look like. I will also need a database of all users that have downloaded the app which can
 be made when the user signs up. Coding will be needed to allow the app to perform its functions to the best of its
 ability and to provide a good user experience throughout it all. The hardware that is needed is a mobile phone to access
 and run the applications features properly, a phone with plenty of storage and memory would be suggested so the features
 don’t run slow and can be very smooth and clean for the user to use.</p>


<h2> Outcome </h2>
<p>If the project were to be successful, the outcome of the project will be that more people will  have an 
interest in watching AFL games and end up going to the footy. The social aspect of the game will increase and
 the users will  have more people to meet up with and chat with, expanding their friendship networks with people 
 of similar interests. It provides a whole new experience for the user as it provides a more in depth analysis of 
 the game while also having fun and talking to new people</p>
